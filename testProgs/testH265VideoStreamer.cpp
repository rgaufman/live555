// main program
//
// NOTE: For this application to work, the H.265 Elementary Stream video file *must* contain
// VPS, SPS and PPS NAL units, ideally at or near the start of the file.
// These VPS, SPS and PPS NAL units are used to specify 'configuration' information that is set in
// the output stream's SDP description (by the RTSP server that is built in to this application).
// Note also that - unlike some other "*Streamer" demo applications - the resulting stream can be
// received only using a RTSP client (such as "openRTSP")
