  //          the frame data is copied to the address pointed to by "fTo".)

  //         (If the actual frame is larger than this, then it should
  //          be truncated, and "fNumTruncatedBytes" set accordingly.)
  // 'out' parameters (these are modified by this function):
  //     fFrameSize: Should be set to the delivered frame size (<= fMaxSize).
  //     fNumTruncatedBytes: Should be set iff the delivered frame would have been
  //         bigger than "fMaxSize", in which case it's set to the number of bytes
  //         that have been omitted.
  //     fPresentationTime: Should be set to the frame's presentation time
  //         (seconds, microseconds).  This time must be aligned with 'wall-clock time' - i.e., the time that you would get
  //         by calling "gettimeofday()".
  //     fDurationInMicroseconds: Should be set to the frame's duration, if known.
  //         If, however, the device is a 'live source' (e.g., encoded from a camera or microphone), then we probably don't need
  //         to set this variable, because - in this case - data will never arrive 'early'.
