A.7 Computing the RTCP Transmission Interval

   The following functions implement the RTCP transmission and reception
   rules described in Section 6.2. These rules are coded in several
   functions:

       o  rtcp_interval() computes the deterministic calculated
          interval, measured in seconds.  The parameters are defined in
          Section 6.3.

       o  OnExpire() is called when the RTCP transmission timer expires.

       o  OnReceive() is called whenever an RTCP packet is received.

   Both OnExpire() and OnReceive() have event e as an argument. This is
   the next scheduled event for that participant, either an RTCP report
   or a BYE packet.  It is assumed that the following functions are
   available:

       o  Schedule(time t, event e) schedules an event e to occur at
          time t. When time t arrives, the function OnExpire is called
          with e as an argument.

       o  Reschedule(time t, event e) reschedules a previously scheduled
          event e for time t.

       o  SendRTCPReport(event e) sends an RTCP report.

       o  SendBYEPacket(event e) sends a BYE packet.

       o  TypeOfEvent(event e) returns EVENT_BYE if the event being
          processed is for a BYE packet to be sent, else it returns
          EVENT_REPORT.

       o  PacketType(p) returns PACKET_RTCP_REPORT if packet p is an
          RTCP report (not BYE), PACKET_BYE if its a BYE RTCP packet,
          and PACKET_RTP if its a regular RTP data packet.

       o  ReceivedPacketSize() and SentPacketSize() return the size of
          the referenced packet in octets.

       o  NewMember(p) returns a 1 if the participant who sent packet p
          is not currently in the member list, 0 otherwise. Note this
          function is not sufficient for a complete implementation
          because each CSRC identifier in an RTP packet and each SSRC in
          a BYE packet should be processed.

       o  NewSender(p) returns a 1 if the participant who sent packet p
          is not currently in the sender sublist of the member list, 0
          otherwise.

       o  AddMember() and RemoveMember() to add and remove participants
          from the member list.

       o  AddSender() and RemoveSender() to add and remove participants
          from the sender sublist of the member list.
